        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Bedrock is the codename for our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.angular.io">Angular</a> Component
            library. Venzra has been built over the past 2 years and we have extracted these from our commerce platform
            and we have been making several improvements while doing this, which we intend to bring back across to the
            platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was influenced by the <a href="https://material.angular.io" target="_blank">Angular
            Material</a> project, we utilise the Angular CDK to build various components. The aim was to introduce our
            own look and feel to bring an alternative and build out missing components we require. We hope others can
            also benefit from this Framework when building their projects.
        </p>
        <p>Usage of these components is made available under the MIT license.</p>
        <p>
            Every component has been tested to work on current browsers. Support for older browser is being improved but
            some issues may exist.

        <h2>Quick Start</h2>
        <p>To install simply add <strong>bedrock</strong> as a project dependency.</p>

        <docs-code content="home/install.md"></docs-code>

        <p>
            The components are built to be used on an as needed basis, benefiting from Angular's tree shacking
            capability. Once installed use our documentation to enable as required and use the components to build your
            website.

            We are building out the documentation and bringing across components as fast as possible. Please bear with
            us, and feel free to contribute to the GitHub project.
