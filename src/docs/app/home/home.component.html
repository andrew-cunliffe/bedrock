        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Bedrock is the codename for our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.angular.io">Angular</a> Component
            library. Venzra has been built over the past 2 years and we have extracted these from our commerce platform
            and we have been making several improvements while doing this, which we intend to bring back across to the
            platform.
        </p>
        <p>Usage of these components is made available under the MIT license.</p>
        <p>Every component has been tested to work on all current browsers. Support for older browser is being improved
            but potentially some issues may exist.

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To install simply add <strong>bedrock</strong> as a project dependency.</p>

        <pre>
            <span>npm i @venzra/bedrock</span>
        </pre>

        <p>The components are built to be used on an as needed basis, benefiting from Angular's tree shacking
            capability. Once installed use our documentation to enable as required and use the components to build your
            website.

            us, and feel free to contribute to the GitHub project.
